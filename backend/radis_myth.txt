How to Install and Run Redis
On macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install redis
brew services start redis

On Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server

On Windows

You can install it via Docker:

docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis


Then Redis is running locally on:

redis://localhost:6379

⚙️ 6. How Celery Connects to Redis

In your celery_app.py:

CELERY_BROKER_URL = "redis://localhost:6379/0"
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = "redis://localhost:6379/0"


That tells Celery:

“Use the Redis server running on port 6379 as both the message broker and the place to store results.”

📦 7. Quick Mental Picture

Imagine Redis as a queue table like this:

Task ID	Task Name	Args	Status
123abc	daily_reminder_runner	None	queued
124bcd	generate_export_csv	{"user_id": 42}	queued

🧠 Celery Beat adds new rows (tasks)

👷 Celery Workers read & remove rows as they complete them

Redis keeps everything moving safely and quickly
