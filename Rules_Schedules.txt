Admin Makes rules using (ReminderRulesAdmin) - stored in ReminderRules by routes/admin_rules /api/admin/rules....
Beat scans every hour (tasks.schedule_daily_reminders) the ReminderRules and filters eligible candidates and puts them in 
ReminderJob to be executed.
Beat also schedules every minute execution (tasks.process_reminders) -> service.reminder_service- which reads 
ReminderJob and if the time to recieve matches sends the mail & mars it done.

ReminderRulesAdmin can show the pending Rules waiting to be executed. If Admin chooses to execute 
imediately, it gets executed. without waiting for the beat.

contents of ReminderJob - pending messeges to be delivered - waiting for theright time - can be seen in console

Other scheduled tasks by beat waiting for execution can also be seen in the tasks tab.
